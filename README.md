# Q1
#### Describe at least five key events in the development of the internet:
-In the 1980's the internet became a worldwide network.  One of the computer scientists who made a large contribution to this peoject was Vinton Cerf.  Vinton Cerf worked at DARPA from 1976-1982.  He helped develop TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol) which allows computers on all the worlds network to communicate with each other.
- In 1988 the first computer worm, The morris worm was distributed on the internet.  I was one of the first computer worms distributed on the internet.  Within 15 hours two thousand computers were infected with the worm.  The worm's damage cost was 100,000 - 10,000,000 U.S dollars.  Robert Tappen Moris, the writer of the worm, was the first felony conviction to happen in the US under the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.
-  In 1992 dial up internet was first offered commercially. Pipex in the United Kingdom and Sprint in the United States were the first providers. An early form of dial up internet was called USENET.  USENET was developed by two graduates of Duke university.  Thier Unix based system used a dial up connection to transer data through telephone modems.  Once broadband internet was introduced in the late 1990's dial up internet became less popular. 
-  In 1998 Google officially launched.  Google became the most used web search engine.  Google was developed by two stanford students, Larry Page and Sergey Brin.  They expanded google from an initial project called "BackRub".  BackRub focused on solving the problem of finding which web pages link to a given page.  The idea was to create an alogorithm that would rank the output for a given URL.  This would be a more efficient way to search the internet.
-  In the late 1990s there was a growth in the adoption of the internet.  This along with more internet company based stock being purchased created the Dotcom Bubble.  At its peak in 2000 the NASDAQ rose by 400%.  In 2002 the NASDAQ fell by 78%, and many companies shut down and failed as a result.  By the end of the fall companies had lost Five Trillion dollars in market capitalization.

# Q2
#### Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:
- **Packets**: A network packet concept is very similar to a postal letter.  The data is carried by a network.  In this data the header can be compared to an envelope of a letter. The data that is carried, the Payload is similar to the contents of the letter.  The footer would be like the signature of the letter you are sending.  Packets are the express mail of the internet, they have better bandwith utilisation and respond faster than the traditional cicuit-switching techonolgy.  In October 29, 1969 the first ARPANET link was established between the University of CAlifornia and the Stanford Research Institute.  The ARPANET design included packet switching.

- **IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)**: An Internet Protocol address is also known as IP address.  An IP address can be thought of as a unique identifier for each computer.  There are two standard for IP addresses, IPv4 and IPv6.  IPv4 is used by all computers with an IP address.  The internet before IP addresses was not as alrge and commercial as it is today.  Many networks were private and closed off from other networks.  Having only 32 bits to identify a unique internet address was not going to be enough and would cause people to panic.  With IPv4 there 232 possible combinations,  this equates to 4.3 billion unique internet addresses.  IPv6 was seployed and is used in some computers today.  It was deployed to meet the need for more internet addresses.

- **Routers and Routing**  :  A router forwards data packets between computer networks.  A router is similar to a traffic controller.  The router directs the data, such as email and web pages, in the form of data packets.  When a data packet is recieved, the router reads the network address in the packets header and then finds the packets final destination.  Most common routing scenarios are from home and offices.  This would be by commercial and consumer routers products.  The most common example would be between a users router and their internet providers.  The home router connects to the internet through an ISP (internet service provider).

- **Domains and DNS** :  A Domain Name System , DNS, is very similar to a phonebook or contact list.  People enter the domain name, such as nytime.com, and are then taken to the website.  The Domain names are reprsenting the computers IP addresses.  IP addresses are difficult to remember,  DNS solves the problem for people of remembering unique IP addresses.  Instead of having to remember a group of numbers the remember the domain name.  The DNS translates these names into the associated IP address.

# Q3
#### Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:
- **TCP**: TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol.  With TCP protocol a connection is established from both ends.  This connection is maintained until the entire message is recieved at it destination IP.  The TCP is similar to a GPS system in a sense,  they are both in control of the route that is taken to get to the destination.  The TCP will break the packet data into packets.  It will then send the packets of data to the same destination but it may use diferent routes to get there.  The TCP waits until all data packets have arrived at the destination, then it assembles the data in a file ready for the application to recieve.
- **HTTP**:  HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the set of rules for transferring files, such as text, graphic images and sound.  Communication on the internet is done by client and server communication.  The client is usually the browser and servers are usually computers.  Communication is done by what is called request and response.  A client will send an HTTP request to the web.  The server recieves the request and returns an http response.  

- **Web Browsers**: A web browser is an application that is used to access information on the internet such as websites.  When a user makes a request for a webpage the browser will then render the HTML to the browser window.  The HTML that is rendered to the screen can include links, images, and text.  Other languages that are read and rendered by the browse are CSS (Cascading Style Sheets ) and Javascript.

 # Q4
#### Identify three data structures used in the Ruby programming language and explain the reasons for using each.

- **Arrays**:  An array in computer science is a collection of elements.  These elements usually include strings and integers.  To find the index of an array you use integers. Uses for arrays include:
	- A base for more advanced data structures
	- Gathering results from a running loop
	- Accessing Elements
	- Searching through a collection of elements
- **Hash**: A Hash is a dictionary-like collection of unique keys and their values. A hash is similar to an array and allows you to map data. 
	- As a way to have named parameters in functions
	- Easy way to represent data structures
	- Organise Data by key and value, similar to a dictionary
	- Mapping data, for ex. words to definitions or names to phone numbers
- **Stacks**: A stack is similar to an array.  It also is used to store a collection of objects.  The difference is that when an aboject is added to a stack it is added to the top or the bottom of the stack.  This is called "Last in first out"  Uses for Stacks include:
	- Convert a multi-dimensional array into a one-dimensional array
	- Managing instruction sequences
	- Parsing expressions

# Q5
#### Describe  the features of interpreters and compilers and how they are different.

  A compiler is a program that translates high-level code, such as Ruby and Python, into low-level machine code for the computer to read. The front end of the compiler takes the source code and first ensures there are no errors.  If there is an error a message is displayed for the user.  Different languages produc e different error messages.  If there are no errors another data structure of the code is built and passed into the back end.  The backend will then use this and generate a low level code which the computer can read.

  Interpreters and compilers are very similar in structure. The interpreter lives in the front end.  It will execute the code in the high level language while the compiler is working on the translation for the computer.  The interpreter makes it easier to find error and make changes to the high level code while the program is in operation.  This error handling and management makes up for the speed of the interpreter.  The interpreter can be slower than the compiler because of the error handling.

# Q6
####  Identify  two commonly used programming languages and  explain  the benefits and drawbacks of each.
- **JavaScript**: JavaScript is one of the more popular programming languages in the world.  When you see movement in a website that is more than likely because of Javascript.  An example of such movemoent would be an interactive map.  When use along with HTML and CSS, Javascript can help create interactive and feature rich websites.

	**The Pros**: 

	- Javascript is very fast.  The browser will often run Javascript immediately within the browser.
	- JavaScript is everywhere on the web.  This means that a developer has countless resources at their disposal for learning and community support.
	- JavaScript is client-side and reduces the demand on servers.

	**The Cons**:

	- Since JavaScript code is executed on the client-side it is more exposed.  This allows bugs which can be used for malicious purposes. 
	-A server-side script will  always produce the same output.  When it comes to JavaScript different browsers sometimes interpret JavaScript code differently.  This can create a different user experience for some. 

- **Ruby**:  Ruby is a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. Ruby syntax is said to be pleasant to write.  The code was designed to be natural for people to read.  Ruby errors are also said to be the better error messages amongst programming languages.  Ruby supports object oriented and functional programming.

	**The Pros**:

	- Ruby code is similar to the language the user speaks. 
	- It allows for object-oriented programming and functional programming.
	-Rubys user base is large and very active.  This means ruby gems are not short in supply.
	- Ruby has many libraries and tools to help you along during your development.

	**The Cons**:

    - Ruby programming language is very strict and there is not much room to go off script and wild with the features.
	- Ruby syntax can be very complex for developers to grasp all at once.
	- Ruby is also slower than languages like Java.

# Q7
#### Identify two ethical issues from the areas below and discuss the extent to which an IT professional is ethically responsible in terms of the issue.
Scenario 1: Access to user’s personal information

An IT professional is ethically responsible to ensure that a user’s information is held and transmitted in a secured way.  This is in order to limit the possible access of the data by unauthorised third parties. This means, always keeping data security in the front of your mind when designing a website or application.   By doing this the IT professional ensures that the right controls are in place from the beginning. These controls include things like encryption at rest and in transit, RBAC and access logging.  

Due to the criticality of this issue, there are multiple standards and laws in place for handling of personal information as well as multiple classifications. Generally, data in this area is broken into three types of information:
- Personally Identifiable Information [PII]
- Personal Financial Information [PFI]
- Personal Health Information [PHI]

The way the law handles each of these types are specific to industries and their practices.  The handling of them are very similar. There are multiple institutions which provide advice and standards to help in these spaces with the main one being the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST.  Additionally, to provided standards, there are regulators whom manage specific market segments such as APRA in the financial market and AHPRA for the medical market. Each of these regulators have their own standards which are regularly published such as APRA’s “Prudential Practice Guide - CPG235 - Managing Data Risk” [[https://www.apra.gov.au/sites/default/files/Prudential-Practice-Guide-CPG-235-Managing-Data-Risk_1.pdf](https://www.apra.gov.au/sites/default/files/Prudential-Practice-Guide-CPG-235-Managing-Data-Risk_1.pdf)].
  

Scenario 2: Freedom of thought, conscience, speech and the media

IT professionals have a difficult job in this area as freedom of thought, conscience, speech and media is a prickly, highly politicised, topic during these times. However, In my view it is the responsibility of IT professionals to do two things:

 - Ensure that freedom of thought and speech is upheld
 - Ensure speech is accurate, fair and not infringing on others.

The assumed conflict between the two responsibilities above is what makes this topic difficult but if you also assume a responsibility on the part of the users of any platform it becomes clearer. Users have the responsibility to inform themselves, show respect for each other and not to knowingly disseminate false narratives. It is then the IT professionals responsibility to allow users to have the freedom of thought to share their own narrative (given that it is not false) and when something is found to go against the second condition work to eliminate it immediately.
This ethos is enshrined in the cultures and even encapsulated in the constitutions of many countries including in international law through United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Article 19. It states that:

•Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech_by_country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech_by_country)]

Case Study::

Access to user’s personal information:
There have been multiple notable data breaches in recent years and most are very well known across the industry. Raising names like First American Financial Corporation with their 885 Million customer records shared or Facebook with their 540 million records shared both due to bad security practices [[https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/30/five-of-the-biggest-data-breaches-ever.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/30/five-of-the-biggest-data-breaches-ever.html)], it is key to keep in mind when designing systems which will hold this type of critical, protected data. Additionally to the two examples above, there are dozens which have greatly impacted the Australian public [[https://www.webberinsurance.com.au/data-breaches-list](https://www.webberinsurance.com.au/data-breaches-list)] from Service NSW to the WA Police Force.

 
Theoretically, an organisation can be breached multiple ways but a scenario has been laid out below.

  Company ABC is an Australian recruitment company which manages the recruiting funnel for enterprise clients. This company has a process where potential applications are uploaded in multiple formats to their website for a specific job and the application sitting behind the website opens the file, catalogs the content in metadata and packages the resume into a PDF format for clients.

One day, a malicious actor who wants to access the data which the company holds uploads a document with an embedded application. When the document is open the application infects the host machine and gains root access, allowing the malicious actor to access the internal network including file servers, databases and critical infrastructure. The actor scans through the network until they discover a database where all resumes are held after processing. This actor then exfiltrates the entire database [gigabytes worth of data] successfully compromising all the applicants who have uploaded resumes.

An ethical professional would have to take multiple actions in the case of the breach above. The IT professional has responsibilities to their company, users and the appropriate regulatory agencies. In the case above, the ultimate authority would be the Federal Government as it doesn’t fall under any other agencies. The actions below would have to be taken by the professional:

1 - Identify the breach, notifying internal security teams (if not already involved) to investigate what happened. This will trigger a Major Incident in most organisations.

2 - Immediately close the issue, applying a tactical solution so that no additional data is lost and access has been revoked for the malicious actor

2 - When the size of the breach is known notify the OAIC as appropriate based on their guidelines [[https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/data-breaches/](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/data-breaches/)]

3 - Perform a root cause analysis to identify what went wrong and how to close the gap permanently

4 - Apply a strategic fix which will prevent future losses. This could take the form of a simple application update, a full architecture change or better downstream controls.

In the case of the above, my view is that the largest gaps in security are access to the database not being controlled properly once the actor has internal access. The application running embedded applications, such as MS Macros, the firewall / data egress rules being too open to allow a multi-gigabyte file exiting the environment and lack of strong encryption which would have made the data set unusable. With these controls in place, this type of attack and loss of data could have been avoided.

# Q8
#### Explain control flow, using an example from the Ruby programming language.
- In computer science control flow is the order in which individual statements , instructions or function calls of an imperative program are executed or evaluated.  The related statements are set out in a block of code and work forwards evaluating conditions to determine the next steps/outcomes. As an example, the following Ruby code aims to determine a person's favourite food and then returns a response:
```
   favourite_food = gets.chomp

    puts "What is your favourite food dish?"

    case favourite_food
    when "pizza"
        puts "Great choice, Pizza is the best!"
    when "chocolate"
        puts "Me too! Chocolate is my happy food."
    when "croissant"
        puts "Croissant and Cafe au lait please!"
    when "salmon"
        puts "Can never go wrong with Salmon."
    end 
```

In the above example, the case statement outlines the evaluation.  The user types their response into the console.  Then the ```when``` statements evaluates iterates through the outlined evaluation.  When the input matches the stated case the associated string is then returned to the console.

# Q9
#### Explain type coercion
- Type coercion is the process of changing a data type into another data type for use in your programming. For example: in Ruby, there was a string whith an input of `"9"` but I needed the numerical version to use in a calculation in a later variable or function, I could use a method like `.to_i`.  This appended with the `gets` method that receives it to change the string input to the Integer `9`. Another example of type coercion in Ruby is using `.to_f`.  This will convert the input into a Float (decimal number) for use in the program.

# Q10
#### Describe the data types recognised by the Ruby programming language.
**Ruby Data Types**:
-   _Strings_: A `String` object holds and manipulates an arbitrary sequence of bytes, typically representing characters.  A string of characters is stored in quotation marks.
   eg.
   ``` name = "Jessica"```
-   _Integers_: Holds Integer values.  These are whole numbers and can still be positive or negative.
   eg. 1, 100, -32.
-   _Floats_: these are decimal numbers. They are not contained in any symbols. They can also be positive or negative.
eg. 1.23, 102.4, -32.69
-   _Booleans_:  are  true or false values. They are not contained in any symbols.
  eg.
  ```is_a_human = true```   ```is_a_unicorn = false```

# Q11
#### “There is a restaurant serving a variety of food. The customers want to be able to buy food of their choice. All the staff just quit, how can you build an app to replace them?”
If I was building an app for the restaurant I would have classes such as a customer class, a menu class, payment class and a server class.

-  **Customer**: This class would take the information of the customer and utilise it in the app.
-  **Menu**: This class will provide a structure for the user to choose from and make sure the order is sent.
-  **Payment**:   This class will deal with the payment interaction between the user and the restaurant.
-  **Server**: The server class will take the place of the sever and handle the interaction between the user and their choices from the menu.

# Q12
#### Identify and explain the error in the following code that is preventing correct execution of the program.
```
celsius = gets
fahrenheit = (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32
print "The result is: "
print fahrenheit
puts "."
```

The code above does not convert the user input from a string to an integer.  The code as a result thinks celsius is a string and returns it 9 times.  To fix this you would convert the string to an integer when you get the user input with the ruby .to_i.

```celsius = gets.to_i```


# Q13
#### The following code looks for the first two elements that are out of order and swaps them; however, it is not producing the correct results. Rewrite the code so that it works correctly.

```
arr = [5, 22, 29, 39, 19, 51, 78, 96, 84]
i = 0
while (i < arr.size - 1 and arr[i] < arr[i + 1])
  i = i + 1 end
puts i
arr[i] = arr[i + 1]
arr[i + 1] = arr[i]
```
#### Solution:
```arr = [5, 22, 29, 39, 19, 51, 78, 96, 84]
i = 0
while (i < arr.size - 1 and arr[i] < arr[i + 1])
  i = i + 1 end
x = arr[i]
arr[i] = arr[i + 1]
arr[i + 1] = x
puts arr
```


# Q14
####   Demonstrate your algorithmic thinking through completing the following two tasks, in order:  
i. Create a flowchart to outline the steps for listing all prime numbers between 1 and 100 (inclusive). Your flowchart should make use of standard conventions for flowcharts to indicate processes, tasks, actions, or operations  
ii. Write pseudocode for the process outlined in your flowchart


![Flowchart](/docs/flow.png)


```
range = [1..100]
prime = []
until range_value == 100 {
  check_prime{
    if range_value is prime ( value/1 or value/vlaue = 0 )
	   store in prime array
    else
       evaluate next range_value
    end
   }
}
```
# Q15
#### Write pseudocode OR Ruby code for the following problem:  
  
_You have access to two variables: raining (boolean) and temperature (integer). If it’s raining and the temperature is less than 15 degrees, print to the screen “It’s wet and cold”, if it is less than 15 but not raining print “It’s not raining but cold”. If it’s greater than or equal to 15 but not raining print “It’s warm but not raining”, and otherwise tell them “It’s warm and raining”._

```
raining = true
temperature = 0

if raining == true && temperature < 15
    puts "It’s wet and cold"
elsif raining == false && temperature < 15
    puts "It's not raining but cold"
elsif raining == false && temperature >= 15
    puts "It's warm but not raining"
else
    puts "It's warm and raining"
end
```




# Q16
#### An allergy test produces a single numeric score which contains the information about all the allergies the person has (that they were tested for). The list of items (and their value) that were tested are:  
  
- eggs (1)  
- peanuts (2)  
- shellfish (4)  
- strawberries (8)  
- tomatoes (16)  
- chocolate (32)  
- pollen (64)  
- cats (128)  
So if Tom is allergic to peanuts and chocolate, he gets a score of 34.  
  
Write a program that, given a person’s score can tell them:  
a. whether or not they’re allergic to a given item  
b. the full list of allergies.

```
allergies = {
    "eggs" => "1",
    "peanuts" => "2",
    "shellfish" => "4",
    "strawberries" => "8",
    "tomatoes" => "16",
    "chocolate" => "32",
    "pollen" => "64",
    "cats" => "128"
}
//tell them whether or not they are allergic//
def allergy_score(allergy)
allergy_score = []
  allergies.each do | item, score |
    if allergy == item
      allergy_score.push(score)
      end
  end
  allergy_score.each.sum
end

//prints list of allergies//
print allergies.keys
```
