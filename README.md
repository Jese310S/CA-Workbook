#### Describe at least five key events in the development of the internet:
- Throughout the 1980's the internet transformed into a worldwide network.  This was possible because of a computer scientist named Vinton Cerf, who's work developed a way for all computers on all of the worlds mini networks to communicate with each other.  This was called "Transmission Control Protocol".  Later an additional protocol was added, "internet protocol", known today as TCP/IP
- 1988: The Morris worm or Internet worm of November 2, 1988, was one of the first computer worms distributed via the Internet, and the first to gain significant mainstream media attention. It also resulted in the first felony conviction in the US under the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. It was written by a graduate student at Cornell University, Robert Tappan Morris.
- 1990: Dial-up Internet access is a form of internet access that uses the facilities of the public switched telephone network (PSTN) to establish a connection to an Internet service provider (ISP) by dialing a telephone number on a conventional telephone line. Dial-up connections use modems to decode audio signals into data to send to a router or computer, and to encode signals from the latter two devices to send to another modem.
- 1998: Google, launched by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, went live in 1998.  Revolutionising the way in which people find information online. Larry Page and Sergey Brin, students at Stanford University in California, developed a search algorithm at first known as "BackRub" in 1996, with the help of Scott Hassan and Alan Steremberg.
- 2000: 2000 was the year of the dotcom collapse, resulting in huge losses for legions of investors. Hundreds of companies closed, some of which had never turned a profit for their investors. The NASDAQ, which listed a large number of tech companies affected by the bubble, peaked at over 5,000, then lost 10% of its value in a single day, and finally hit bottom in October of 2002.

# Q2
#### Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:
- **Packets**: A network packet is a formatted unit of data carried by a packet-switched network. A packet consists of control information and user data, which is also known as the payload. Control information provides data for delivering the payload. 
Packet switching is a rapid store and forward networking design that divides messages up into arbitrary packets, with routing decisions made per-packet. It provides better bandwidth utilization and response times than the traditional circuit-switching technology used for telephony, particularly on resource-limited interconnection links.
At a conference, Roger Scantlebury presented  Donald Davies work on packet switching for data communications and mentioned the work of  Paul Baran  at  RAND. Roberts incorporated the packet switching concepts into the ARPANET design and upgraded the proposed communications speed from 2.4 kbps to 50 kbps.
ARPA awarded the contract to build the network and the first ARPANET link was established between the  University of California, Los Angeles and the Stanford Research Institute on October 29, 1969
- **IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)**: An Internet Protocol address is also known as IP address. It is a numerical label which assigned to each device connected to a computer network which uses the IP for communication.
IPv4 was the first version of IP. It was deployed for production in the ARPANET in 1983. Today it is most widely used IP version. It is used to identify devices on a network using an addressing system.  It is considered the primary Internet Protocol and carries 94% of Internet traffic.
IPv6 is the most recent protocol.  This new IP address version is being deployed to fulfil the need for more Internet addresses. It was aimed to resolve issues which are associated with IPv4. 
- **Routers and Routing**  : A router is the traffic controller for data coming from and traveling via the internet. The router is generally connected to two or more points and distributes the packets of information from one source to the other (routing). The most common routing scenarios are experienced in the home and office by general commercial and consumer router products to allow for data exchange with the web and also internal networking.
Larry Roberts’ proposal that all host computers would connect to one another directly was not endorsed. Wesley Clark suggested to Roberts that the network be managed by identical small computers, each attached to a host computer. Accepting the idea, Roberts named the small computers dedicated to network administration, Interface Message Processors, which later evolved into today’s routers.
- **Domains and DNS** :  The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to  IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.  Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address which other machines use to find the device.
Many of the milestones that led to the development of the modern Internet are already familiar to many of us, the invention of DNS the Domain Name System is a part of those milestones.

# Q3
#### Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:
- **TCP**: TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol.  TCP is a connection-oriented protocol. This means a connection is established and maintained until the application programs at each end have finished exchanging messages. It determines how to break application data into packets, which networks can deliver and send to.  It then accepts packets from the network layer and manages flow control. TCP works with the Internet Protocol, which defines how computers send packets of data to each other. Together, TCP and IP are the basic rules defining the Internet.
- **HTTP**:  HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the set of rules for transferring files, such as text, graphic images and sound.  It was developed by Tim Berners-Lee and his team between 1989-1991.  In 1989, while he was working at CERN, Tim Berners-Lee wrote a proposal to build a hypertext system over the Internet. Initially calling it the _Mesh_, it was later renamed to _World Wide Web_ during its implementation in 1990. Built over the existing TCP and IP protocols, it consisted of 4 building blocks (HTML, HTTP, a web browser and a server).  These four building blocks were completed by the end of 1990, and the first servers were already running outside of CERN by early 1991.
- **Web Browsers**: A web browser, or simply "browser," is an application used to access and view websites.  The primary function of a web browser is to render HTML, the code used to design or "mark up" webpages. Each time a browser loads a web page, it processes the HTML, which may include text, links, and references to images and other items, such as cascading style sheets and JavaScript functions. The browser processes these items, then renders them in the browser window.
